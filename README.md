Cluster Overview
A Kafka cluster typically comprises:

Kafka Brokers: Distributes and handles message traffic.
Zookeeper (Optional with Older Versions): Manages cluster metadata and leader elections.
Producers: Publish messages to topics.
Consumers: Subscribe and read messages from topics.
Topics: Organize message streams.
Partitions: Ensure scalability and high throughput

Prerequisites
Using Windows? You'll need to download Windows Subsystem for Linux.

This guide assumes that you already have Python 3 installed. The example was last tested against Python 3.12.1.

The instructions use virtualenv but you may use other virtual environment managers like venv if you prefer.


Create Project
Create a new directory anywhere you'd like for this project:

Copy
mkdir kafka-python-getting-started && cd kafka-python-getting-started
Create and activate a Python virtual environment to give yourself a clean, isolated workspace. You may also use venv if you prefer.

Copy
virtualenv env

source env/bin/activate
Install the Apache Kafka Python client library:

Copy
pip install confluent-kafka
Note: this guide was last tested using version 2.4.0 of the client.
